  <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
     interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized
     as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
     Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of
     the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is
     an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9]
     and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
